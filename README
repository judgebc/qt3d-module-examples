# Qt3D Module Examples

Hello, this is a collection of qt examples that are being gathered in this repository for me to play with under my
own build system.

If you have qt5 installed, you're welcome to run them too!

You can manually execute the cmake and build steps are make use of the `run.sh` shell script.

To generate, build, and run an example use the following command:

`run.sh basic_shapes`

This will execute the basic_shapes example.

To only generate the build system objects you can use the following command:

`run.sh basic_shapes --gen`

To choose the configuration to build and run under, you can do the following:

`run.sh basic_shapes [Debug|Release]`

Currently there's no support for batch files, but it should be fairly straight forward to add. Accepting PRs for it. :)

## Available Examples

[Basic Shapes](./basic_shapes)
[Materials](./materials)
